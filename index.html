                    <p> I am 37 years old and worked in the Termite Control field for over 20 years, starting
                        out as a
                        helper during my High School years and then eventually getting my own truck. It was a
                        small
                        company, and I was able to work my way all the way to running the day to day
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>
                        I have always been fascinated with coding, and would often go on github and just stare
                        at
                        various
                        projects and wish I fully understood what was going on. I love android, and I root and
                        mod
                        every
                        device
                        I get. Currently own a Pixel XL and an old Nexus 7 (2013) that I tinker with when I
                        have
                        the time.
                        Development of any kind is something I am very passionate about.</p>
                    <p>
                        I married my best friend in November 2006 and we have 4 kids, three girls (8, 6, and 3)
                        and one very, very spoiled boy (he is one). His sisters just flock over him and tell
                        him how cute he is. It's got to be a rough life! Spending time with my family is one of the
                        most important things in my life, there is so much impact (good and bad) that you can have on
                        their lives, especially when they are so young!</p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of August 2018 the owner of my
                        company suddenly died with no will and no plan of succession for the company and all the
                        employees where laid off. My wife and I did some praying and soul-searching and I decided to
                        follow my dreams and
                        enroll in this Coding and Web Development Boot Camp. We are all excited to see where this
                        journey takes us, and grateful for the opportunity presented. When I allow myself to step back
                        and look at where I am now compared to a few weeks ago at the start of the class, I am amazed.
                        Still much to learn, but we have come so far!</p>
                    <p>
                        My other technology interest is linux. I am especially a fan of Arch Linux, I love the
                        simplicity
                        of
                        the base distro and the ability to install and configure however you need/want.</p>
