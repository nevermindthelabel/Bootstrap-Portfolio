                                I am 37 years old and worked in the Termite Control field for over 20 years, starting out as a helper during my High School years and then eventually getting my own truck. It was a small company, and I was able to work my way all the way to running the day to day operations.</p>
                                I have always been fasinated with coding, and would often go on github and just stare at various projects and wish I fully understood what was going on. I love android, and I root and mod every device I get. Currently own a Pixel XL and an old Nexus 7 (2013) that I tinker with when I have the time. Development of any kind is something I am very passionate about.<br>
                                I married my best friend in November 2006 and we have 4 kids, three girls (8, 6, and 3) and one very, very spoiled boy (he is one). His sisters just flock over him and tell him how cute he is. It's a rough life!
                                At the end of August 2018 the owner of my company suddenly died and all the employees where laid off. My wife and I did some praying and soul-serching and I decided to follow my dreams and enroll in this Coding and Web Development Boot Camp. We are all excited to see where this journey takes us, and grateful for the oportunity presented.</p>
                                My other technology interest is linux. I am especially a fan of Arch Linux, I love the simplicity of the base distro and the ability to install and configure however you need/want.</p>
