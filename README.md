# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Hosted on GitHub Pages [here](https://nevermindthelabel.github.io/myPortfolio/)

Updated readme and Portfolio after week 11 in Coding and Web Development Boot Camp.

Using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap) and CSS I set about to update and upgrade my Portfolio page. After leaving these technologies behind in the first few weeks of class I was very surprised to see how much I struggled remembering what to do, but going back thru the class work and looking at some tutorials seemed to help out quite a bit.

I learned you are never done learning any technology, even if JavaScript is more fun to play with
